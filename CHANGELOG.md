# Changelog

## [1.3] â€“ 2025-06-25

### âœ… Improvements & Fixes
- Wrapped all `r4mp_*` functions to avoid redeclaration errors when loaded multiple times.
- Implemented redirect loop protection: stops infinite redirects by limiting redirect depth.
- Improved matching performance by reversing fragments and reducing DB lookups.
- Compatibility added for multisite: shared settings when network-activated.
- All settings pages restricted to users with `manage_options` (Admins only).
- JavaScript for image fallback now uses `json_encode()` instead of `esc_url()` to prevent URL encoding issues in JS.
- Added helper `r4mp_get_setting()` to streamline settings retrieval with multisite awareness.

### ðŸ§ª Pro Features (Demo-Enabled)
- Added placeholder license key support (`12345678`) to unlock Pro features.
- Added image fallback for broken `<img>` elements (Pro).
- Added custom 404 redirect URL when no match is found (Pro).

### ðŸ›¡ Security Hardening
- All settings use proper sanitization via `register_setting()` callbacks.
- Output escaping (`esc_attr`, `esc_html`) enforced on all fields.
- JavaScript fallback uses scoped conditions and safe attributes.
- Admin-only interface and options.
- Added basic `SECURITY.md` policy.
